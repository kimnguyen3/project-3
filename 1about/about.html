                        The Wear Down Festival is an annual festival during New York Fashion Week hosted in New York City's Garment District dedicated to educating consumers on the truth behind insustainability in the fashion industry.

                        Fashion sustainability is an issue at the current forefront of the industry. The fashion industry is one of the largest industrial polluters due to its excessive amounts of textile waste along with its unsustainable water usage and contamination. The industry is also infamous for its constant unfair and exploitative labor practices. Consumers should be given the tools to discern corporate deceptions to make better buying decisions.
                        Consumer profits are what drive large corporations to continue these practices, so becoming aware of the issue and where to find alternatives is essential for the fashion sustainability movement.
