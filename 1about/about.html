                        The Wear Down Festival 2023 is an annual festival dedicated to educating consumers on the truth behind insustainability in the fashion industry.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Fashion sustainability is an issue at the current forefront of the industry. The fashion industry is one of the largest industrial polluters due to its excessive amounts of textile waste along with its unsustainable water usage and contamination. The industry is also infamous for its constant unfair and exploitative labor practices.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        "Green-washing" is also a new industry trend wherein a fast fashion brand misleadingly advertises itself as ethical and sustainable without any transparancy with its practices. Consumers should be given the tools to discern corporate deceptions to make better buying decisions.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Consumer profits are what drive large corporations to continue these practices, so becoming aware of the issue and where to find alternatives is essential to the fashion sustainability movement.
